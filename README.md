# Clustering

K-means, Mixture of Gaussians and Silhouette Coefficient calculation implemented from scratch using numpy. This project was implemented for educational purposes.

# Details

ClusterPackage includes functions for clustering (Kmeans and Mixture of Gaussians) as well as a function for calculation of the Silhouette coefficient for validation

In ClusterTheoretical the functions are tested on artificial datasets; in ClusterPractical they are used on a real dataset.

PCA package is required for the ClusterPractical to work
